crt - Clojure Refactoring Tool

## Disclaimer

This is a work in progress. 

## Idea

I'm trying to create a simple tool for the most basic Clojure refactorings, such as rename, extract function and move, as as portable Clojure code. Also there will be various useful visualizations for your Clojure project structure.

## Usage

Add dependency
[crt "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"]

Require the code
(:require crt.core :as crt)

Run the tool
(crt/open-crt)
